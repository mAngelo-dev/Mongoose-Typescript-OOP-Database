# Mongoose + Typescript OOP Fully Tested API 
This API is a demonstration of what I can do with Typescript and Mongoose, also it is implemented with unitary and integration tests maded with Mocha, Chai and Sinon libraries.

This project uses Docker, to run, acess the terminal and type: docker compose up -d to use a detached terminal, otherwise console logs and images warnings will be showed in the terminal.

Also, this is a Node.js API. The Project includes some essencial scripts that you can find in package.json
